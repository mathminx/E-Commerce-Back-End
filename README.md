# E-Commerce-Back-End

This application functions as the back end of an e-commerce site. It is a command line application comprised of an Express.js API that uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. It uses the dotenv package to store sensitive data using environment variables (MySQL username, password, and database name).
